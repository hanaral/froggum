Features to be implemented:
 * More grid levels / custom grid
    Useful, but not absolutely necessary.

 * Gradients
    Necessary.

 * Transparency
    Necessary.

 * Custom image sizes
    Basically done, just needs a way to choose the size.

 * Rulers
    Useful, especially at larger sizes.

 * Status bar
    Shows current pointer position; width, height, angle of arc segments; etc.
    Useful, not necessary.

Bugs to be fixed:
 * Useless buttons:
    Delete Segment (context menu)

    Edit name of path (sidebar)

 * Crashes when trying to split arc segment.

 * Open method is terrible
    Use a real xml reader, and save everything from the original file.
    Will be very important once gradients are added.
