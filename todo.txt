Features to be implemented:
 * Opening files 
    This is absolutely necessary.

 * Dragging entire paths
    This is incredibly convenient, especially when copying a path to another place without grid help.

 * More grid levels / custom grid
    Useful, but not absolutely necessary.

 * Gradients
    Necessary.

 * Transparency
    Necessary.

 * Custom image sizes
    Basically done, just needs a way to choose the size.

 * Rulers
    Useful, especially at larger sizes.
