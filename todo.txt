Features to be implemented:
 * Opening files 
    This is absolutely necessary.

 * More grid levels / custom grid
    Useful, but not absolutely necessary.

 * Gradients
    Necessary.

 * Transparency
    Necessary.

 * Custom image sizes
    Basically done, just needs a way to choose the size.

 * Rulers
    Useful, especially at larger sizes.

 * Status bar
    Shows current pointer position; width, height, angle of arc segments; etc.
    Useful, not necessary.

Bugs to be fixed:
 * Useless buttons:
    Delete Path (context menu)
    Delete Segment (context menu)
    Delete Path (toolbar)
    Open (new tab)

 * Crashes when trying to split arc segment.
